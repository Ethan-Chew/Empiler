# OCBC Live Chat and Improved FAQ Forum
Users can connect with a live advisor to resolve their inquiries through a streamlined process. They start by navigating a webpage to select relevant categories and answer simple questions, narrowing down their issue. If available, users are then shown FAQs relating to their issue. Else, they will be prompted to start a Live Chat (recommended) or call the Hotline. The homepage also allows users to view their chat and support history. An estimated wait time is displayed for live chat assistance; if the wait is too long, users can opt to schedule a live chat appointment instead.

Agents manage multiple chats through a dedicated portal, receiving AI-driven recommendations to aid their responses. At the conclusion of each live chat, users can rate their advisor's helpfulness. If further assistance is needed, agents have the capability to help users schedule an appointment at a physical bank branch. This system integrates AI to enhance the user experience and support efficiency, ensuring that users receive timely and appropriate solutions to their queries.

Further accessibility features including, but not limited to, Text-to-Speech and Multi-Language support.

All of these are done while ensuring the upmost security of the customer's personal data.
